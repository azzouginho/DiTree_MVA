## 🚀 Our Contribution: Guided Tree Search

While the original DiTree relies on global diffusion policies, exploring complex mazes with narrow passages remains challenging. In this fork, **we implemented a Guided Tree Search strategy** to bias the exploration.

### Key Features Implemented:
* **BFS Initialization:** We introduced a discrete grid-based BFS pre-processing step (`generate_intermediate_goals`) to find a coarse path skeleton avoiding static obstacles.
* **Intermediate Goals:** The planner now automatically generates a sequence of intermediate waypoints along the BFS path.
* **Biased Sampling Strategy:** Modified the `RRT.py` expansion loop. Instead of sampling purely randomly or towards the final goal, the tree now progressively targets the next intermediate goal based on a proximity cost heuristic (`get_distance_to_goal`).

**Result:** This approach significantly reduces the time to find a first solution in "Maze" environments by guiding the diffusion sampler through bottlenecks.

## 📦 Installation

We recommend creating a Python virtual environment before installing dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yanivhass/ditree.git
cd ditree
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

3. **Install PyTorch**
   Visit [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to find the correct installation command for your system (CPU or GPU).
   Example (CUDA 11.8):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

4. **Install other dependencies**
We provide here a minimal list of depencencies for running the car experiments. Other functionalities might require additional installation (e.g. Mujoco's Ant requiring Mujoco). 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
